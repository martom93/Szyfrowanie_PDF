The program is used for encrypting PDF files. The user has two options for encrypting files:

1) Select specific files to encrypt.
2) Select a folder from which all .pdf files will be encrypted.

Next, the user specifies the destination folder where the encrypted files should be saved. The next step involves entering the encryption password twice to avoid accidental keyboard errors. Additionally, the program is protected against incorrect passwords, empty fields, or incorrect file and folder paths.

=====================================

To be implemented in future updates:

=====================================

* A checkbox for entering individual passwords for each file in the list.
* A dropdown list containing predefined passwords that are most frequently used by the user.
